# BulletHell
Simple Bullet Hell game made in C++ and SDL2\
It was created during my first year of university (2022-01)\
We were constrained in which libraries or features we could use, so I made my own Vector and String libraries and some other utilities.\
All assets except for font are made by me.

## Features:
- **Multiple stages** - Currently 3 stages and bosses, each with unique AI.
- **Advanced projectiles creation** - Currently you can create your own projectiles and customise: duration, delay, if it explodes into other projectiles, and type of projectiles (normal, big, circular, beam) and other.
- **Health pickups** - They are randomly spawned during your game and will regenerate lost health.
- **Score and combo system** - Gained score depends on your current combo, which can go from F to as high as S
